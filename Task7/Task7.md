```
Title: Timing & Optimizing

    Design an object that keeps time between 2 points.

1. Create a class

   Search on the internet how can you keep time. 

   a. Give a proper name to the class
   b. Write a contructor
   c. import necessity libraries
   d. design 2 functions:

2. Function 1

   When this function is called, the timer starts to count.

   Give a proper name

3. Function 2

   When this function is called, the timer stops.

   Give a proper name

    3.1 Create another method.:

        Print the report. How much time passed or additional
        properties that you thought.

    3.2 Save the log

        Save the report as txt file and every execution should be unique.

5. Now you created your own module !!

    You need to make it private if you want to sell it.

    5.1 Your object must have 2 Keys

        5.1.1 SECRET_KEY

            This key will be a string and you decide it's value

        5.1.2 PRIVATE_KEY

            This key will be unique for each customer. So that they cannot share your module.

    5.2 If key doesn't match inform the user and ask them yo buy it.
